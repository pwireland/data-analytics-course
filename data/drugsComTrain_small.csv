95260,Guanfacine,ADHD,"""My son is halfway through his fourth week of Intuniv. We became concerned when he began this last week, when he started taking the highest dose he will be on. For two days, he could hardly get out of bed, was very cranky, and slept for nearly 8 hours on a drive home from school vacation (very unusual for him.) I called his doctor on Monday morning and she said to stick it out a few days. See how he did at school, and with getting up in the morning. The last two days have been problem free. He is MUCH more agreeable than ever. He is less emotional (a good thing), less cranky. He is remembering all the things he should. Overall his behavior is better. 
We have tried many different medications and so far this is the most effective.""",8,27-Apr-10,192
92703,Lybrel,Birth Control,"""I used to take another oral contraceptive, which had 21 pill cycle, and was very happy- very light periods, max 5 days, no other side effects. But it contained hormone gestodene, which is not available in US, so I switched to Lybrel, because the ingredients are similar. When my other pills ended, I started Lybrel immediately, on my first day of period, as the instructions said. And the period lasted for two weeks. When taking the second pack- same two weeks. And now, with third pack things got even worse- my third period lasted for two weeks and now it&#039;s the end of the third week- I still have daily brown discharge.
The positive side is that I didn&#039;t have any other side effects. The idea of being period free was so tempting... Alas.""",5,14-Dec-09,17

The only downside is that it made my periods longer (5-6 days to be exact) I used to only have periods for 3-4 days max also made my cramps intense for the first two days of my period, I never had cramps before using birth control.

I feel healthier, I&#039;m excelling at my job and I always have money in my pocket and my savings account.  I had none of those before Suboxone and spent years abusing oxycontin.  My paycheck was already spent by the time I got it and I started resorting to scheming and stealing to fund my addiction.  All that is history.  If you&#039;re ready to stop, there&#039;s a good chance that suboxone will put you on the path of great life again.  I have found the side-effects to be minimal compared to oxycontin.  I&#039;m actually sleeping better.   Slight constipation is about it for me.  It truly is amazing. The cost pales in comparison to what I spent on oxycontin.""",9,27-Nov-16,37

My Dr. prescribed me 2mg of Abilify and from that point on I feel like I have been cured though I know I&#039;m not.. Bi-polar disorder is a constant battle. I know Abilify works for me because I have tried to get off it and lost complete control over my emotions. Went back on it and I was golden again.  I am on 5mg 2x daily.

It really did help me by completely clearing my acne, this takes about 6 months though. I did not gain extra weight, or develop any emotional health issues. I stopped taking it bc I started using a more natural method of birth control, but started to take it bc I hate that my acne came back at age 28. I really hope symptoms like depression, or weight gain do not begin to affect me as I am older now. I&#039;m also naturally moody, so this may worsen things. I was in a negative mental rut today.

Now, other side effects, they are there the word recall issues exist, the memory issues, the worst of it seems to be the vision disturbances, there have been times I have just not driven because I&#039;m sure it would not have been safe.

Have recently had a bad flare and narrowing at the anastomosis and need to be on medication, but haven&#039;t found one that I can handle.

Helped tremendously with the cough but then I was having bad stomach cramps and diarrhea. I hadn&#039;t eaten anything that should have upset my stomach and it didn&#039;t really feel like a &quot;bug&quot; so I looked up side effects for Delsym.

I&#039;ve never had acne problems in my life, and immediately broke out after getting it implanted. Sex drive is completely gone, and I used to have sex with my boyfriend a few days a week, now its completely forced and not even fun for me anymore. I mean I&#039;m on birth control because I like having sex but don&#039;t want to get pregnant, why take a birth control that takes away sex?

It has since subsided and the only side effect I notice now is the dry mouth.  I make sure to drink  2.5 litres of water a day (about 10 glasses).  This helps with the weight loss as well as the constipation.  I have been reducing my dose to find a comfortable spot where I am still losing weight but don&#039;t feel like I am over medicating.  For me, 1.8 is working very well.  I also feel wearing a Fitbit has really helped.  I can track my food, water, exercise and steps - it keeps me moving more.

Unfortunately once the tablets finished the infection returned so needed a 2nd course. I&#039;m currently taking a low dose at evening to keep the infection at bay while the specialists do some tests.  I normally get every side effect going and dread taking new medication in any form especially after an horrific experience with Ciorofloxacin but the only side effect I experienced with this was itchy ankles and feet on day two but that didn&#039;t last into third day so I would class this as a minor side effect and insignificant.

After 2 weeks I had some breakthrough pain, so my Dr increased my dosage to 50mg and I&#039;m still on that dosage today. For the first full year I was on this I never had pain and felt &#039;cured&#039;. As time went on, it seems to help control my pain. I do still have pain, but at a low manageable level.

Within a few days of starting Lamictal (was on Tegretol) it was as if someone had turned a light on in my head. Is this the way &quot;normal&quot; people think? was one of the first things that struck me. I sleep like a log, have no irritability, almost no anger (other than what would be considered normal). I am able to focus and my creative, impulsive thoughts have decreased enough to be manageable. It&#039;s a God send as I would perennially be in a state of hypo mania, which sounds great, but I was physically and emotionally exhausted.

The second gave him a nasty tic that thankfully went away as soon as he stopped the med, the third worked for a couple of years and around January of last year we started to have problems so his doctor recommended Daytrana. It has been wonderful for my son! Easy to use, he handles this for himself each day and takes it off when he gets home from school. The patch effects last long enough for him to do his homework.

I am a patient diagnosed with disorganized schizophrenia, depression,  schizoaffective disorder, bipolar.  I have experienced a sensitivity to my emotions, as well as how I react to my feelings.  I really don&#039;t feel out of the normal with any &quot;sexual frustration&quot;...and I wouldn&#039;t say this has increased/decreased.  I feel less anxious on the medication, and seemingly more at ease with myself when I take this medication.  It is a hard step to have people telling you that you actually do better on this pill, when half your life ago, you didn&#039;t have &quot;mental illness&quot;, and suddenly you become someone else.   My weight did fluxuate when on this drug.  But I feel it was due to stress factors outside of a regular environment.  I feel if you place yourself in good surroundings and support you do much better at being the person you are here to be.  I am so much happier in life with a routine.  I feel like I only referred to enlongated periods of sleep because of depression, and events surrounding certain time frames hence thoughts, and reactions.
Abilify (aripiprazole) My instant reaction from this drug is concern for my well-being.  I am nervous because I am one of the people taking this drug till the stars fade, every day to my last.  My doctors all seem to say the same thing, and that is, &quot;This medication is working for you&quot;.  I do blood tests when I go into the Hospital freqently, and they are not finding anything off the charts and everything is always normal with my vitals. 
My thought is, how do they consider this medication works for me?  Because I am not showing side effects?  Because I am accepting?  I feel I have to hold patience, my own value, what I care about around me to help better myself mentally and my virtue.  I feel that I am just not the type of person to curbside answers to things we wonder deeply about, I guess.  
I don&#039;t know if there are any people who would agree then that I should ask if there are any women who have taken abilify during a pregnancy?  Just wondering what the reaction is...  Is my question?  I am a 30 year old female diagnosed with Mental Illness starting in 2004.  I started to take Abilify 20 mg. in 2004 to present.

However, I&#039;m also on a pretty high dose of Lexapro, and the Dr. thinks it&#039;s more likely to be a side effect of that, so we&#039;re decreasing that and hopefully that will work, because otherwise I&#039;m feeling really good.

My only issue was I ended up so dehydrated that I showed up to my colonoscopy with a fever. Try to drink as much fluid as you can with this prep! I drank plenty, but there was more liquid coming out of me than going in. Overall, I would recommend the Prepopik.

I have a flat tummy and it looked like I was pregnant which was painful and annoying.  This also gave me a very backed up system which I never get.  I got extremely nauseous, very moody, heartburn, anxiety and some depression.  The only pro was that my breasts grew a cup size.  Can&#039;t complain about that!

I regularly take Kamagra, which is generic Viagra, and that does work. Viagra is better, and I can get away with half the dose that I use for Kamagra, but it still costs 5 times as much. The slight difference is that Viagra swell the penis a little and possibly numbs it s little too, making you last longer.

My acne also got worse during these first three months. A lot of whiteheads and bumps that never fully emerged. I pushed through thanks to these reviews and by the 4 month, things started looking up.

This medicine works...if you really want to quit smoking.  It isn&#039;t magic and you do have to put some effort in.  Of course you will be cranky and a bit more anxious than normal, your brain has no idea how to deal with stress without smoking.  None of these are reasons to not try it.

I take 2 capsules at onset and one more tablet each hour after as needed (usually total of three capsules is enough!) Only side affect is it makes me sleepy.

Immediately after, I became very pale and lightheaded and had to use the restroom. I could hardly sit up in the bathroom because I was so lightheaded and nausea caused me to vomit. I was so weak and honestly wanted to just lie on the floor because I began to sweat. After about 30 minutes, I was able to stand up and drive home.

By the end of work I felt really emotionless and had a head ache, and when I got home at 6 I began crying for no particular reason. After crying I felt much better and focused very well on school work. Now I feel happier but surprised by how much of a roller coaster the whole day was.

The only thing I dont like about the medication is the severe tingling in my hands, feet, fingers, and lips.""",10,19-Feb-15,43
130001,Levonorgestrel,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,"""Tried pill form birth control for a few years before getting off of it because it caused some strange mood swings/anxieties. Felt better off birth control for 1 full year but decided to try Mirena because I was getting my period after like 10 days from stress/etc. I took 4 Advil the morning of and the procedure was a bit uncomfortable but it kind of reminded me of getting an ear piercing ... it&#039;s painful but it&#039;s not like the worst type of pain ever. I  just did a lot of deep breathing through it. Had cramping for a few days but just keep the Advil pumping! Discharge in the beginning, but pretty much smooth sailing now 2 months later. It&#039;s great!""",9,03-Feb-15,37
121066,Venlafaxine,Depression,"""My doctor prescribed 37.5 mg to me.  I took one at 3:00p.m. and by 7:00p.m. I was feeling dizzy and nauseous.  I actually was able to fall asleep but woke up several times during the night with horrible nausea, shaking, anxiety, weird dreams, and the a lot of gas!  Thank goodness I had Zofran for nausea or I would have thrown up. I also had to take an Ativan for the anxiety and Imodium for diarrhea.  It&#039;s now 5:00p.m. the next day and I&#039;m just now feeling better. I know others who use Effexor and love it so it does work for some....just not for me.  I called the doc and she quickly switched me to something else.""",1,21-Feb-17,17
163246,FreshKote,Eye Redness,"""This is the first prescription eye drops that has worked wonders for my severe dry eyes.  Nothing else has worked but Fresh Kote has been a wonderful relief and it doesn&#039;t burn when I use it.""",10,22-Apr-11,21
131794,Effexor XR,Depression,"""Effexor has been the most effective antidepressant for me. I&#039;ve tried 5  SSRI&#039;s. Effexor doesn&#039;t make me lazy or spaced out. I feel it helps my cognitive functioning, as well as focus, motivation and memory. I will go off effexor for periods of time, plenty of time for my brain/body to reset, but I keep finding it better to be on Effexor. It&#039;s helped me to not be so negative, irritable and just miserable overall. I can feel its slight pain killing effects as well. It keeps me doing things instead of laying in bed ruminating negative thoughts. Side effects for me are constipation and lower libido. Miralax fixes the first one. As for the second one, before Effexor I wasn&#039;t socializing at all anyways, so the I can handle that side effect.""",9,02-Jun-15,62
163966,Fluorouracil,Warts,"""So I have had this wart on my thumb near my nail for about a year now. Finally I went to the derm and she told
Me it was a periungal wart. I was told to use this cream overnight with a bandaid until it was gone. It has been over a month and still no progress. It still is growing and still looks the same as it did. Advice is welcome. I have a bigger one on my left thumb and smaller one on my
Right.""",1,31-Jul-15,12
